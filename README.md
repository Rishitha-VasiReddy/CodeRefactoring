# CodeRefactoring
The code selected for refactoring is sourced from [this](https://github.com/iluwatar/java-design-patterns/blob/master/api-gateway/api-gateway-service/src/main/java/com/iluwatar/api/gateway/ImageClientImpl.java) repository.

Image Client Implementation class acts as an adapter to communicate seamlessly with the Image microservice through a straightforward HTTP GET request. The finalized code has been meticulously analyzed to adhere to good coding standards, ensuring clarity, maintainability, and reliability.
## Features
- Simple and concise API for fetching image paths from the microservice.
- Integrated `SLF4J` logging to record detailed information about the execution flow, facilitating debugging and monitoring.
- Utilizes the `@Component` annotation, indicating that the class is a Spring component, allowing seamless integration with the Spring framework.
- Properly licensed under the MIT License and well-documented for easy understanding of its purpose and usage.
## Refactoring
- **Logging and Error Handling**: The code employs `SLF4J` logging to provide a detailed log of the communication process. However, the exception handling in the `getImagePath` method is minimal and can be enhanced for better error reporting and recovery.
  
- **Detailed Exception Handling**: The code currently catches `IOException` and `InterruptedException` without providing detailed error messages. Enhance exception handling to deliver more meaningful information in the event of an exception.

- **User-Friendly Error Page**: Consider implementing a user-friendly error page to effectively communicate to users when an exception occurs during the image path retrieval process.

- **External Configuration**: The URL "http://localhost:50005/image-path" is hardcoded. Consider externalizing such configurations to a property file or a configuration class for enhanced flexibility.
